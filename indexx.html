                <h3><span>1</span>M3</h3>
                <p>Hi i'm Mik3 or should i say Miguel Montero... im 24 years old, i've always lived in Puerto Rico most of the time in San Juan where i currently live, i've had oportunitys to live on other countries but i really enjoy living here.</p> 
                <br>
                     <p>I consider mys3lf an entrepren3ur and a hustler because since early stages of lif3 my family thought me the value of mon3y and since i could i started doing different jobs just to have lunch money, basketball shoes, and games to play with. 
                     Since my childhood i have enjoyed all kinds of sports, i started playing baseball and basketball since i was 5 years old and later on i played softball, bowling, football, volleyball and any sports i could get my hands on i was there.</p>
                     <br>
                      <p>Fast forward i've always been interested in the t3ch world and it has reflected on my lif3, since younghood i jailedbreaked an ipod so i could get apps for free and cool backgrounds, after that i moded a ds with tons of games, then an iphone and the list goes on.
                       My family always tried to encourag3d me to get a degree on t3ch but i was scared of pursuing it and failing.
                        But that didn't chang3d that i still work3d on different technolgies like crypto, network marketing, ecommerce and forex and thats not counting all the work i've done on Excel, powerpoint, word, and many more for my studies on accounting in highschool, when i studied criminal justice on college and the jobs i've had . </p>
                    
                    
                <h3><span>2</span>Mys3lf</h3>
                <p>Going a little bit in depth about mys3lf i'm a father of a 4 year old boy whom i'm proud of having. 
                    Currently i work on a callcenter helping veterans recieve compensation when it's due to them and doing uber eats as a side hustle.</p>
                    <br> 
                    <p>I like investing i discovered it with an academy that teaches people about different streams of incomes that you can access trough your phone or how its populary called "wifi mon3y".
                    I also like reading books i discovered it after going to college, its funny to me because before that the only books i read where books that i had to read for school but when i read "birdbox" a thriller horror book i discovered that i do actually enjoy a good read and after that ive read all kinds of books.</p>
                    <br>
                   <p>In my lifetime i've gotten to know me and like the title at the begining says "expect the un3xpected" i think that defines me because i'm a person that likes challenges and growth so i'm in constant move trying to learn from everything life throws at me and excel with every rash decision ive taken. </p>
